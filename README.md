## Note:
<br>
_Please note that peasapi is included for making it easy for people who cant pay people to make mods for them  and instead make your own mods but if you want to learn cool stuff like custom maps and advanced roles like the thanos role learning C# is more than important.
<br>
_Please also note that peasplayer had no contribution on this repository and everything here i included by me for making it easy for beginers.

# Getting Started...
Important links:
<br>
[Docs](docs.reactor.gg) (API for modding) 
<br>
[Second Api](https://docs.peasplayer.tk/among-us-lessons/) (For making it easy) 
# Once you finish all installation steps do this:
Ill be showing you how to make a role now:
(put the file as role.cs in your exampleproject/modname directory)
[role.cs](https://github.com/PixelDev990/Among-Us-Modding/blob/main/AU-Modding%20Src/Roles/ExampleImposter.cs)

[Full Code Here](https://github.com/Peasplayer/ExampleAmongUsMod/blob/master/ExampleMod/)

Thanks to peasplayer 

# Got an error? No problem!
[Support](reactor.gg)
# To finish up build your mod and setup a server!

To make a server the best software i'd say is [Hindenburg](https://github.com/SkeldJS/Hindenburg)
<br>
Once you setup your hindenburg server you're free to play and test you're role with your friends!

## Advanced Modding Coming Soon......
